# All models
Load data

```{r}
bodyF <- read.csv("./bodyfatmen.csv",
               header = TRUE)

View(bodyF)

```

Create full model
```{r}
bodyF.model <- lm(density ~ ., data = bodyF)
summary(bodyF.model)
```
We see that the model have a lot of confidence with abdomen and wrist but no so much with height, chest, hip, knee, ankle and biceps
